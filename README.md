# 🧠 Introspection, Retrocausality, and the Meta-Conscious Timeline

A philosophical and scientific synthesis exploring the nonlinear nature of time through introspection, retrocausality, and meta-consciousness. This paper integrates insights from quantum mechanics, cognitive neuroscience, Eastern philosophy, and metaphysics to propose a new epistemic model of reality.

## 📄 Abstract

This paper explores the nonlinear nature of time through the lenses of Eastern and Western philosophy, quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and cognitive science. We investigate how introspection and retrospection may influence the perceived and actual structure of time, proposing a framework that incorporates retrocausality and meta-consciousness. We argue that consciousness cannot be reduced to the body and brain, yet it influences and shapes both. This inquiry highlights the need for a new epistemic model that integrates metaphysics, inner observation, and empirical science.
